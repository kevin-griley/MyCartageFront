# Secure and Simplified Data Protection for Your Trucking Company

At MyCartage, we understand the importance of protecting your valuable data. That's why we use the same technology as the largest and busiest corporations in the world - a variety of Serverless components including compute, database, and cache systems. Our auth system is built on Azure B2C, which holds the highest standards for authentication and is used by even government agencies.

With our system, you don't have to worry about ransomware or backups. Our databases are automatically backed up and replicated in multiple zones and parts of the country, and our systems are serverless and scale automatically, ensuring they are always available. With HTTPS SSL on web app SAAS services, you don't need to host local hardware, worry about VPNs, or keep your systems online.

We understand that not every trucking company has a full staff of IT workers, and that's okay. By letting professional services handle your data protection, you can simplify your tech needs and save costs. Our software runs in any browser since it's primarily a web application, so you don't have to worry about IT and data security. This gives you the freedom to focus on running your business without the added worry of IT.

Don't put your millions of dollars in receivables at risk by hosting your records on local hardware. Switch to MyCartage's secure system with Azure B2C OAuth2 and simplify your data protection needs.
